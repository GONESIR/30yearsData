The beautiful game of soccer through its main governing body FIFA has recorded scores for the last 150 years. This project takes a look at how history has shaped the sport from 1872 to the World Cup 2022, as we prepare for the next World Cup that will be housed on home soil, in the US. The cup will be hosted in 8 cities in the US and a couple from Mexico and Canada. The tournament has been expanded to more games and teams, which may mean more fun than ever! What does the data tell us about the story so far and how this expansion may impact the tournament? Join the countdown to the greatest show on earth — the 2026 FIFA World Cup — and experience a celebration of sport, culture, and unity that will leave a lasting impact for generations to come.

Future Scope: With the effect of hosting the games and introduction of arguably one of the greatest players, Lionel Messi into Major League Soccer, it will be interesting to see the effect this has on the future of soccer in the US. Continual studies would be comparing this timeline before and after this monumental event.
